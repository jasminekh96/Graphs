# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:

def island_counter(self, grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
        
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] == '1':
                self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                count += 1
    return count

def dfs(self, grid, i, j):
    if i<0 or j<0 or i>=len(grid) or j>=len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '1':
        return
    grid[i][j] = '#'
    self.dfs(grid, i+1, j)
    self.dfs(grid, i-1, j)
    self.dfs(grid, i, j+1)
    self.dfs(grid, i, j-1)



grid = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
print (island_counter(grid, 'None')) # returns 4



# islands consist of - connected components 
# connected - neighbors (edges)
# directions, nsew(edges)
# 2d array - graph, more or less
# returns (shape of solution) - number of islands
